.Op -m Ar memberspec

.Ar -n name

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is short for Tiny Code Generator, a program that creates abstract 
data types (ADT) in C.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n Ar name
Name of the ADT. 

.It Fl m Ar memberspec
Specifies the members in the ADT. We use (a slightly modified)
printf() syntax to specify the type of the members.
Each memberspec is *terminated* with a semicolon(;).
 %d   int
 %d8  C99 int8_t
 %d16 C99 int16_t
 %d32 C99 int32_t
 %d64 C99 int64_t
 %u   unsigned int
 %u8  C99 uint8_t
 %u16 C99 uint16_t
 %u32 C99 uint32_t
 %u64 C99 uint64_t
 %f   float
 %g   double
 %s   char*
 %Ns  char array, where N is number of characters including the '\\0' string terminator.
 %p   pointer to void.
.Pp
Example:
 -m "name=%20s;age=%d;average_salary=%g;"

.It Fl p Ar prefix
A prefix to be used in the guard macro name. If the ADT is
named foo, a guard macro will be named FOO_H unless a prefix
is used as well. If the prefix is MYLIB, the guard will be 
named MYLIB_FOO_H
.It Fl b Ar basename
tcg will create two files, a header file and a c file. The
basename for these files will be the same as the name of the adt
unless -b basename is used.
.It Fl c Ar copyright
Add a copyright message to all generated files.
.It Fl S
Add a type-safe stack.
.It Fl C
Generate a check program, which will test the ADT.
.It Fl F
Generate functions to read and write the ADT from/to a FILE*.
.It Fl H
Generate a hybrid ADT implementation. Hybrid ADTs will have
inline access functions, and the struct definition will reside
in the header file instead of the source file.
.It Fl M
Generate man page templates for the ADT and its member functions.
.It Fl P
Generate pack functions. When this option is used, three functions
are added to the ADT. These three functions will be named adtname_pack(),
adtname_unpack() and adtname_packsize().
.Pp
Note that not all data types
can be packed into a char buffer, only char arrays and the C99 fixed
size integers(intX_t and uintX_t) will be packed/unpacked and included
in the size computation. The reason is that we only pack data types
we can represent on all platforms.
char[] members will be packed with exact max length, including
the trailing zero.
We do not use the ntohl() function(and friends) since we want
the code to work on non-POSIX platforms. For now we always do
the conversion to/from Network Byte Order ourselves.
